Would you like to meet my little friend?
Don't try to shake his hand he's just pretend.
His name is Benjamin, that's his name.
My Mamma says, "you're insane,
Boy you really are the end,
You and your imaginary friendâ??.
Daddy drives the mobile library.
He works peripatetically.
He doesn't get much time to play with us
So we just read and make up stuff.
And it drives him round the bend,
Me and my imaginary friend.
One day we're gonna play hide and seek
And Ben will be up the creek,
Never to be seen again.
He'll disappear the day that childhood ends
And reality descends.
I'll never forget you my imaginary friend.
