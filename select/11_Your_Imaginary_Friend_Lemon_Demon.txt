Simple and small
Almost alone
Curled up in a ball
With a tin can phone
Tied to a twist
Leading outside
And into the mist
Where the shadows hide

Maybe when you're gone
We'll gladly take your place
You're so nicely drawn
We like your face, and

We want to be your imaginary friend
Want to be your imaginary friend

When you were young
You knew us well
The cat had your tongue
So you could not yell
When you were cross
All you could do
Was call it a loss
Though this was not true

We've since disappeared
That is, until tonight
When you turn out the light
And everything stands still
The wind's direction shifts
And makes the curtains lift
And you see us on the sill

Every word that you've learned
Every wish that you've burned
Every single strand of hair in your head
Every book that you've read
We love you this much!

We want to be your imaginary friend
Want to be your imaginary

Friend
